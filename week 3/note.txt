The first condition (if (!(username == "mukul" && password == "pass"))) uses the logical 
NOT (!) operator to negate the result of the expression inside the parentheses. It checks 
if the username is not "mukul" or the password is not "pass". If either condition is true, 
the entire expression becomes true.

The second condition (if (username != "mukul" || password != "pass")) uses the logical OR 
(||) operator. It checks if the username is not "mukul" or the password is not "pass". If 
either condition is true, the entire expression becomes true.
